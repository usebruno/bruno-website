Hey everyone !

I am so happy to share that we have received a grant of Rs 5 lakhs (USD 6000) from Samagata Foundation ðŸ’›

[Samagata Foundation](https://samagata.org/) is a non-profit organisation in India that supports projects and ideasâ€”even the little onesâ€”that bring value to society. They work across areas including science, culture, art, technology, and education with a specific focus on the creation of public commons, institutions, and community spaces.

Bruno is an Opensource, Fast and Git-Friendly Opensource API client aimed at revolutionizing the status quo represented by Postman, Insomnia and similar tools out there. Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem using a plain text markup language, Bru. You can use git or any version control of your choice to collaborate over your API collections.

As of today, Bruno has been downloaded over 100,000 times, has garnered over 10,000 stars on Github and is used by over 25,000 developers every month.

Majority of the features in Bruno are free and open source. We strive to strike a harmonious balance between open-source principles and sustainability.
The funding grant will help us continue to expand our open-source work.

Onwards and upwards! ðŸš€

Best,

Anoop
