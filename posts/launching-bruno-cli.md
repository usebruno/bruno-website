Hello everyone!

I am excited to announce the release of Bruno CLI, a new addition to Bruno. The CLI allows you to run API collections from the command line interface, making it easier to test and automate your APIs.

## Installation

To install the Bruno CLI, use the node package manager of your choice, such as NPM:

```bash
npm install -g @usebruno/cli
```

## Getting started

Navigate to the directory where your API collection resides, and then run:

```bash
bru run
```

This command will run all the requests in your collection. You can also run a single request by specifying its filename:

```bash
bru run request.bru
```

Or run all requests in a folder:

```bash
bru run folder
```

If you need to use an environment, you can specify it with the --env option:

```bash
bru run folder --env Local
```
