Hello everyone! üëã

We're happy to announce that the **Version 1.0.0** is finally here! üéâ

In the post, we'd like to share what V1 means for Bruno, some of the highlights of the journey so far, and what's next.


## Version 1.0.0

We actually wanted to get a [lot of things](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/384) done before we release V1. But the community [felt that](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/issues/643#issuecomment-1766707137) we are already there, and that a lot of people and teams are already using Bruno in production.

This made sense to us. V1 does not mean that we have all the bells and whistles. It's more of a message that we are ready for production use. We have a stable API, we have a stable CLI, and we have a stable UI. We have a lot of features, and we have a lot of things to improve. But we are ready for production use.


## Beginnings

Bruno started as a passion project in late 2021. I set out to build a beautiful curl UI.

I worked on it, mostly alone, for 2 years until the stars aligned on September 28th 2023.
The project got visibility and it has been a wild ride since then.
I wrote about the [early days and struggles here](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269)

You can also read about the origins of the git nature of Bruno [here](/blog/the-saas-dilemma).


## Github Stars

The star counter went crazy, we experienced vertical liftoff.
It tooks us **2 years** to got from **0 to 500 ‚≠ê**, and **10 days** to got from **500 to 5000 ‚≠ê**.

As of this writing, we have over **7k stars**.

## Monthly active users

It's not just stars, we also massive growth of people who use bruno. For 23 months, we had around 100-200 people who used Bruno every month. But in the Oct 2023, we had **over 20,000 people** use Bruno.

## Contributors

Bruno's community has experienced remarkable growth, seemingly out of nowhere. In the span of a single month, from October, the number of contributors surged from **15** to a remarkable **86**. What's even more impressive is that during October alone, we successfully merged over **200 pull requests**.

And there are still over **50 pull requests** waiting to be [merged](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/pulls).

This rapid pace of growth is also a testament to the quality and robustness of our codebase, which allowed us to readily accept these contributions and scale up with confidence.

We can't thank enough üíõ to all the people who contributed to Bruno and helped us get here.

## Reaction

It has been exhilarating to see the reaction of the community. We are not an alternative, but a new way of working with API Collections. We are re-inventing the Api Client.

You can check out the testimonials on our landing page. If you'd like to share your experience with Bruno, please [write here](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/343)

People love the opensource, git-friendly, fully-offline approach of Bruno.

## FOSS 3.0 Conference

Our talk was selected for the FOSS 3.0 conference. We also had a booth setup and we met a lot of people who use Bruno. It was a great experience.

## Bruno ?

I shared the story of how Bruno got its name [here](https://youtu.be/7bSMFpbcPiY?si=Gno9M7G5LFdwa1Yg&t=869). You can go to the 14:30 mark in the video to hear the story.

Here is Bruno. The prince who will be fetching your Api's.

## What's Next ?

I have been documenting the journey of Bruno [publicly here](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269). You can checkout our [roadmap](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/384)

Our mission is to

* Build the most simple, beautiful, and powerful API client that developers love.
* And uphold these principles
  * üë©‚Äçüíª Opensource - build collaboratively, code released under MIT license
  * üîí Privacy - Collections are stored locally
  * üïäÔ∏è Freedom - Free to use and modify.
  * ü§ù Community - Foster a thriving community of contributors and users
  * üìú Transparency - Document the journey openly and engage in public discussions
  * ü§ë Sustainability and Incentives - Generate income along the way

As far as how we build a sustainable business, we are still in the process of figuring out a right balance that works for the community, the contributors and the creator. We are exploring a few options. We are also open to ideas and suggestions. If you have any ideas, please [share here](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/384).

We are here for the long run. We want to give developers what they have always wanted. A beautiful curl UI.

Godspeed üññ üê∂ üíõ
