            It's time for a revolution in API client technology. The status quo,
            represented by Postman, has become bloated and unwieldy. We refuse
            to be shoehorned into a proprietary version control system for
            collaborating on API collections.
          </div>

          <div className="mt-6">
            We are an open source project, rising up against the monopoly of
            bloated and closed systems. We believe that API collections should
            be co-located within your source code repository, serving as a
            living set of examples on how to use the API.
          </div>

          <div className="mt-6">
            But we realized that the current tools on the market export
            collections as giant JSON files (a.k.a ugly blobs), difficult to
            version control and diff. So we created the Bru Markup language,
            saving information about your API requests using plain text files.
          </div>

          <div className="mt-6">
            With Bruno, collections become first-class citizens, co-located with
            related information and easily version controlled. We say goodbye to
            bloated workspaces and global environments, and embrace the benefits
            of co-location.
          </div>

          <div className="mt-6">
            We dream of a world where developers can clone a code repo, get it
            up and running, use Bruno to browse the examples on how to use the
            API and start playing with it. No more horror stories of{' '}

              the company last month."

          <div className="mt-6">
            Join us in our mission to create a better API client for developers.
            Say goodbye to bloatware and hello to simplicity, efficiency and
            freedom. Try Bruno today and experience the difference for yourself.
