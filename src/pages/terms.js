                    <p>
                      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the
                      Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that
                      you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date,
                      with the full payment corresponding to the billing period

                      Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription
                      fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to
                      pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
                    <p>
